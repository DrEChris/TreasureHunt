# TreasureHunt
A text based adventure, with the goal of finding treasure.

Note: The code for this game is a work in progress.
      At this time the only way to play the game is to open the .jar file through the command prompt window.
      To do this simply download the 'TreasureHunt.jar' and 'TreasureHunt.bat' files.  Make sure to put them in the same folder in your computer.  Once downloaded, open the batch file (TreasureHunt.bat) and it will start the game.
      
      
In the future, extra content will be added, including a User Interface which will make the game accessable outside of the command prompt.
      
      
This game is text based, so the computer will write messages to you and you will tyoe commands into the computer.
The program is designed to understand simple commands in English, so try not to be too fancy.
    For example:  "go north", "walk to the north", and "head towards the north" are all acceptable.
                  But, "quickly walk north" or "head northwards quietly" will not be understood.
The program uses directions (North, South, East, West, Up, and  Down) but also will recognize some landmarks.
    For example: "go to the well" will bring you to the well as long as you are near it.
This is a treasure hunting game, which means that it is full of hidden objects and puzzles.
    Commands like "search" or "look" will help you find things, while commands like "get" and "pickup"
    will allow you to take them with you.  You can also "use" items.
    
The rest of the game's secrets are for you to discover.  Happy Hunting.
